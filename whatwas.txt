resizing th ewindow: originally image was stretched and didn't follow original resolution.
lack of stock functions on documentation made it difficult
it doesn't work with react 16 and barely works with react 15 with 3d party packages, not the original one.
 I was trying to resize canvas and it was difficult but when i finally managed to do this only canvas was resizing not the image and it became black
image size didn't correspond to canvas size
then formula to keep one side and devide other side based on window size
and then another fornula to keep it centered
